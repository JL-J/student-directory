# student-directory

A simple project during the Makers pre-course to develop a student directory script which allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

## Objectives of exercise ##
Practise writing Ruby code including methods, loops, opening/saving/loading files. 

## Getting started ##
`git clone git@github.com:JL-J/student-directory.git'

## How to use ##
``` shell 
ruby directory.rb
```

## Current issues ##
- Occasionally prints footer twice, in particular when creating a new file.
- You can open two csv files at the same time. If possible, it would be helpful to have a warning before opening a second csv file.
